# Soil Monitoring System

## Overview
This project implements a Zigbee-enabled soil monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system collects soil moisture data from various sensors and provides real-time updates through a dashboard and mobile application.

## Features
- Real-time soil moisture monitoring
- Zigbee communication for sensor data transmission
- User-friendly dashboard for data visualization
- Mobile application for remote monitoring

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Configure the settings in `config/config.yaml` and `config/secrets.yaml`.
4. Run the application using `python run.py`.

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main application code.
- `config/`: Configuration files for settings and secrets.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the application.
- `docs/`: Documentation files.
